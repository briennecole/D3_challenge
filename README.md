# D3_challenge

The task was to take Census data and create a scatter plot between two of the data variables. I chose poverty and smoking.

Using the D3 techniques we learned in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. We had to code this graphic in the app.js file of the directory and pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Additionally, the graph needed to include state abbreviations in the circles and create and situate our axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart. Finally, we were to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:5500 in the web browser.

An image of my final graph and link to the github.io page are below.
