          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Poverty Levels</h2>
          <p>Cigarettes were first introduced in the United States in the early 19the century at which time, they were a wealthy person's luxury.
            Their popularity reached its peak in the 1950's and 60's. Then, the 1964 Surgeon General's report received widespread media
            coverage and prompted a decline in sales. In 1966 the first cautionary label appeared on packs. So why is smoking still prevalent
            in today's society and is there a correlation between it and poverty level?
          </p>

          <p>A quick analysis of US state census data shows a fairly strong positive correlation between states with higher poverty rates and percent of the population that 
            smokes (exact r value not computed). In fact, according to truthinitiative.org, 72% (nearly 3 out of every 4) of smokers are from lower-income communities. So why is this?</p>

          <p>Research has shown that tobacco and poverty create a vicious cycle. Financial burdens and other stressors are what most people attribute their smoking to. 
            However, in turn, those families spend a larger proportion of their income on tobacco and like products. Money spent that cannot be spent other needs including
            but not limited to, food and healthcare. A few statistics published by the "World Health Organization are listed below":

            - It is the poorer and the poorest who tend to smoke the most. Globally, 84% of smokers live in developing and transitional economy countries.
            - At the country level, tobacco consumption varies by socioeconomic group. In many countries, at all levels of development and income, it is the poor who smoke 
            the most and who bear most of the economic and disease burden of tobacco use.
            - A study of smoking prevalence among men in Chennai (India) in 1997 shows that the highest rate is found among the illiterate population (64%). 
            This prevalence decreases by number of years of schooling, and it decreases to about one fifth (21%) among those with more than 12 years of schooling.
            - A study in the United Kingdom shows that only 10% of women and 12% of men in the highest socioeconomic group are smokers while 35% of women and 40% of men in 
            the lowest socioeconomic group smoke.
